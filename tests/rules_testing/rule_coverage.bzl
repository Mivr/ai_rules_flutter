"""Shared `rules_testing` assertions for per-rule analysis tests.

Every public rule and macro has a direct analysis test whose subject is that
rule or macro: a test that a provider field or an action disappeared fails, so
`bazel test //...` cannot stay green while a rule loses one. The assertions
the tests share live here, so each test states only what its rule documents.

A rule that registers no action of its own carries a
`# rule_test_coverage: no-actions` marker above its definition; its test calls
`expect_no_actions`, so the marker cannot outlive the fact it records.
