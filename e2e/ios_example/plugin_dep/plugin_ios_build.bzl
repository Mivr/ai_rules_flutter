"""Build a plugin fixture for the iOS device platform from a macOS host.

The plugin's Flutter framework import is an iOS XCFramework, so its inner
`objc_library` must compile for iOS even though the surrounding `build_test`
runs on the macOS host. The transition keeps the test runner in the default
configuration while moving only the library it builds.
