# Run-HOME hermeticity

No runnable target may let the dart CLI, pub, flutter_tools, or the Dart
VM write telemetry or state into the caller's `HOME` (RT37-flutter:02:
`CLIENT_ID` and `dart-flutter-telemetry-*` appearing under `~/.dart-tool`
after `bazel run //flutter:pub`).

## The two policies

- Caller-home: the tool CLI must resolve the caller's `PUB_CACHE` and
  credentials, so the parent environment is kept and a command-form CLI
  takes the global `--suppress-analytics` flag instead. Applies to
  `//dart:dart` (SDK pass-through) and `//flutter:pub`.
- Private: the spawned program gets a fresh dir for `HOME`,
  `USERPROFILE`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `APPDATA`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`,
  `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, and `XDG_DATA_HOME`, removed afterwards. Applies to
  the `flutter_tester` spawn and the web/Linux integration launchers
  (browser profile, Xvfb, desktop app).

User app and test code keeps the caller env; only rule-owned launchers
and tool CLIs are routed through the helper.

## The helper

`flutter/private/tools/run_home.dart` is the single source: `homeEnvKeys`,
`suppressAnalyticsFlag`, `withSuppressedAnalytics` (the flag before the
command for command form only, never duplicated), `isFileForm`,
`createPrivateHome`, `privateHomeEnv`. The integration launchers' old
per-launcher scrubs fold into it — there is one copy of the key list.

The flag is command-form only: the Dart VM rejects `--suppress-analytics`
for file-form executions (`dart program.dart` exits 255), so file form —
a program path, an empty argument list, or global flags only — passes
through with the caller env kept. Telemetry the SDK itself writes on a
file run is outside what the launcher can suppress, so the gate pins rc
and output for file form while command-form rows pin clean canaries.
Leading dash-arguments are skipped before deciding: `--verbose pub get`
still suppresses, while `--enable-asserts hello.dart` stays untouched.

Launchers that are shell templates cannot import Dart, so
`flutter/private/run_home.bzl` carries the shell counterpart
(`RUN_HOME_SH`, plus `RUN_HOME_SUPPRESS_ANALYTICS` for the Windows
launcher). The two copies are asserted equal by
`//flutter/private/tools:run_home_test`; update them together.

## The gate

`e2e/run_home` is a self-contained workspace with one instance of every
`bazel run`-capable entry point. `registry.tsv` records label, args, and
HOME policy per entry; `audit.tsv` records every other executable target
with the reason it is out of class. `run_home_test.sh` replays the
registry's `bazel query` enumeration (an unregistered or missing entry
fails the run), then executes each entry under canary home dirs and fails
naming any entry that creates, changes, or removes canary content. It runs
in Linux CI.

## Adding an entry point

1. Add a runnable instance to `e2e/run_home/BUILD.bazel` (or record why
   the target cannot run headless).
2. Add the row to `registry.tsv` (run rows) or `audit.tsv`
   (out-of-class, with reason), using the shared helper for its launcher.
3. The gate fails until the new entry is both registered and clean.

Bazel itself never runs with the canary variables: each entry is staged
first under the caller's environment (`bazel run --script_path=...`), and
only the generated stage script runs under the canaries.
