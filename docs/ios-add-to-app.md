# Add-to-app iOS xcframeworks

Flutter's documented add-to-app path embeds a Flutter screen in an existing
Xcode application. The Xcode target links prebuilt xcframeworks produced by
`flutter build ios-framework`; `rules_flutter` produces the same artifact set
hermetically with `flutter_ios_xcframeworks`, from an ordinary
`flutter_application`.

This page is the detailed reference. The README section is the short version.

## Usage

```starlark
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")
load("@rules_flutter//flutter:ios.bzl", "flutter_ios_xcframeworks")

flutter_application(
    name = "my_app",
    main = "lib/main.dart",
    deps = ["@deps//:flutter"],
)

flutter_ios_xcframeworks(
    name = "my_app_xcframeworks",
    application = ":my_app",
)
```

`bazel build //:my_app_xcframeworks` writes the set under
`bazel-bin/my_app_xcframeworks/`:

```
my_app_xcframeworks/
  App.xcframework/
    Info.plist
    ios-arm64/App.framework/
    ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/App.framework/
  Flutter.xcframework/
  FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework/
  <Plugin>.xcframework/
```

Add each `.xcframework` directory to the Xcode target under **Frameworks,
Libraries, and Embedded Content**, with **Embed & Sign**.

`flutter_ios_xcframeworks` is exported from `flutter/ios.bzl`. The target is
tagged `manual` by default and restricted to macOS hosts, because the AOT
device and simulator slices need a Darwin host to compile.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Target name. `DefaultInfo.files` is the xcframework set. |
| `application` | A `flutter_application` target. Required; omitting it fails with `flutter_ios_xcframeworks: application is required`. Its transitive native plugins become xcframeworks. |
| `minimum_os_version` | Minimum iOS deployment target written into every framework plist. Defaults to `IOS_MINIMUM_OS_VERSION`, which is the version the prebuilt engine is built for; a lower value is refused. `App.framework` keeps the value its own framework rule writes. |
| `visibility` | Standard target visibility, forwarded to the result target. |
| `tags` | Standard Bazel tags. Defaults to `["manual"]`; the internal device and simulator targets are always `manual`. |
| `target_compatible_with` | Standard compatibility constraints. Defaults to `["@platforms//os:macos"]`; override it only if another host can build the Darwin slices. |
| `**kwargs` | Other common target attributes (`testonly`, `features`, and so on) are forwarded to the result target. |

## What each xcframework contains

### `App.xcframework`

Exactly two slices:

| `LibraryIdentifier` | `SupportedPlatform` | `SupportedPlatformVariant` | `SupportedArchitectures` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ios-arm64` | `ios` | — | `[arm64]` |
| `ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator` | `ios` | `simulator` | `[arm64, x86_64]` |

Each slice is an `App.framework` with the AOT `App` binary, its `Info.plist` and
`flutter_assets/`. The device slice is built for `ios_arm64`; the simulator
slice is `macho_edit fat` of the `ios_sim_arm64` and `ios_x64` builds. Both
slices are AOT snapshots and export the engine's
`_kDartSnapshotText`/`_kDartSnapshotData` symbols, not the debug stub.

The add-to-app macro reuses `flutter_ios_framework` rather than assembling a
second App.framework. Its private `allow_simulator_aot` attribute makes the
simulator slice AOT, which ordinary simulator apps leave off because the
JIT-only simulator engine cannot load AOT code.

### `Flutter.xcframework`

This is the pinned iOS engine the rules already select for the compilation
configuration (`@flutter_ios_engine` for release and debug,
`@flutter_ios_engine_profile` for profile; see `flutter/private/ios_app.bzl`).
The rule writes the xcframework layout by symlinking every engine file at its
existing relative path, so the slice binaries are the pinned engine's own
files, never copied or rewritten.

### `FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework`

The application's generated `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.swift` is linked with
the plugin aggregator into a dynamic framework. Device and universal simulator
slices carry the same registration calls the Bazel runner uses, so an Xcode
runner can call `GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with:)`.

### `<Plugin>.xcframework`

Every native iOS plugin in the application's transitive graph contributes one
xcframework named after its pub package. The framework's binary is the plugin
library's compiled output from `ios_libs` (usually a
`flutter_apple_plugin_library`); its module and headers are the ones the
registrant imports. A plugin package named `App`, `Flutter` or
`FlutterPluginRegistrant` is refused because its xcframework would collide with
the three fixed names.

## Hermetic assembly

No action runs `xcodebuild -create-xcframework`. The rule writes each
`.xcframework/Info.plist` and framework `Info.plist` in Starlark, symlinks the
engine and plugin files, and uses the `macho_edit` host tool the Apple rules
already run to fat-fuse, retag and install-name the linked slices. That is the
same tool and the same slice layout `flutter_darwin_xcframework_import` reads.
No new download and no extra host tool is introduced.

## Proof

`e2e/ios_framework` defines a plain `flutter_application`, a first-party Swift
plugin, and the macro over them. Its macOS-only
`//:verify_ios_xcframeworks_test` reads the built outputs and asserts:

- `App.xcframework/Info.plist` lists exactly the two slices in the table above;
- the device App slice is 64-bit arm64 Mach-O with platform iOS (2) and the
  simulator slice is 64-bit arm64 + x86_64 with platform iOS-simulator (7);
- both App slices export the AOT snapshot symbols;
- the `Flutter.xcframework` device binary is byte-identical to the pinned
  engine file included in the test data;
- `FlutterPluginRegistrant.xcframework` registers the workspace plugin; and
- the plugin's xcframework carries the plugin's compiled code.

The workspace is part of the `e2e-macos` matrix in
`.github/workflows/full.yaml`, so a plain `bazel test //...` in it runs the
proof on macOS.
