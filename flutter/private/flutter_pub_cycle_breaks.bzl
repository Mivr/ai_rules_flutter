"""Cycle-breaking helpers for `flutter.pub` spokes.

A pub lock may hold two packages that depend on each other, such as `dio`
and `dio_web_adapter`. Pub resolves that lock because a conditional import
picks one side per platform, but one Bazel repository per package turns the
pair into a repository cycle. `flutter.pub(cycle_breaks = ...)` names the
spoke-to-spoke edges to leave out; these helpers hold the two checks that
keep the escape hatch honest.

The extension validates lock membership before it creates any spoke; a spoke
validates that each break names an edge its own pubspec declares. Both
helpers are pure so unit tests drive them with plain strings and lists.
