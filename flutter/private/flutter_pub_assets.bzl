"""Variant-aware expansion of pub package `flutter.assets` entries.

flutter_tools parity for `flutter.pub` spokes (`flutter_pub_package.bzl`):

- A file entry bundles its main file plus every resolution variant living
  in a sibling `<N>x` / `<N.M>x` directory (`_AssetDirectoryCache.variantsFor`
  in `packages/flutter_tools/lib/src/asset.dart`), each inheriting the
  entry's `platforms` / `flavors`. A variant-only entry (main absent) is
  accepted; an entry with neither a main file nor a variant fails the fetch.
- A trailing-slash directory entry bundles the directory's own files plus
  each one's variants. Files in deeper subdirectories are not bundled
  (`listSync()` without recursion in `_parseAssetsFromFolder`).
- Every walk is bounded and fails loudly at the bound instead of silently
  dropping files.

The pure core (`list_files_recursive`, `expand_pub_asset_entries`) works
over caller-provided `readdir` / `list_dir` callables so unit tests drive it
with fakes; the spoke passes context-backed adapters and `fail()`s the
fetch on the returned error, which already names the package and the entry
or directory.

Every entry is normalized through `asset_uri.bzl` (string entries read
like `Uri.parse`, map-form entries like `Uri(pathSegments:
path.split('/'))` in flutter_tools 3.47.7): the file is resolved
from the decoded path while the emitted `key` carries the percent-encoded
bundle key. A spelling flutter_tools would not bundle (a query, an
escaping `..`, an invalid escape, ...) refuses here, naming the package,
its pubspec.yaml and the entry.
