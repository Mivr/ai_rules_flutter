"""A public `flutter_font_family` rule and the shared font validation.

COV-29. A font family declares each font with the asset path of the file it
ships, so a font and its file pair by that path and never by their position
in a list. `flutter_font_family` and the legacy `fonts_json` / `font_files`
path that `flutter_library` and `flutter_plugin` share both go through the
checks here: an asset with no file, a file no family names, and a weight or
style flutter_tools refuses all fail analysis, naming the target, the family
and the path. The refusal text is flutter_tools' own, for example
`Invalid value 750 ((int)) for font -> weight.`.
