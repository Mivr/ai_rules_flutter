"""The lazy Android half of a `flutter.pub` plugin spoke.

A plugin's Gradle model is read here, in its own repository, only when an
Android target analyses the spoke's `android:lib` alias. The spoke fetch never
touches `android/build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts`, so an iOS-, macOS-, web-
or Dart-only consumer can resolve a hub whose plugins declare coordinates
rules_flutter cannot translate; the refusal fires only when the model is
actually needed.

`flutter_pub_android_package` carries either the hosted package archive or the
path package's `android` platform directory, reads the one Gradle build
Gradle would evaluate, and emits the same `kt_android_library` the spoke used
to emit. `android_package_repo_name` and `android_spoke_alias_content` are the
pure pieces the spoke generator and its unit tests consume.

    Always emits a `kt_android_library(name = "lib", ...)`. The aggregator

    every spoke; plugins without Android sources still contribute an empty
    library (a no-op at link time).

    Loaded lazily — Bazel only parses this file when something analyses
    `@<android-repo>//android:lib`. Non-Android workspaces never trigger it
    and don't pay the `@rules_android` / `@rules_kotlin` cost.

    The `_engine` target gives the plugin's Kotlin/Java source access to
    the FlutterPlugin SPI on the compile classpath. It is `neverlink`, as
    Gradle gives a plugin the embedding with `compileOnly`: the app
    packages its own engine, of the ABI its
    `flutter_android_app(android_abi = ...)` names. The plugin's is the
    arm64 one whatever the app's ABI, since Java bytecode is
    ABI-independent, and packaged it would put an arm64 engine in an x64
    APK. The engine also exports the embedding's
    androidx dependencies (see `_ANDROIDX_EMBEDDING_DEPS` in
    `flutter/android.bzl`), so a plugin whose `build.gradle` declares no
    dependencies still compiles against `NotificationCompat` & co. —
    exactly the compile classpath Gradle gives it via the
    `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_*` POM.

    BuildConfig.java is generated from the plugin's `java_package`. Many
    Flutter plugins reference `BuildConfig.DEBUG`, which Gradle synthesizes
    automatically; rules_android does not. We emit a minimal stub so the
    plugin's source compiles. `DEBUG = false` is the safe default —
    Flutter's Bazel build is release-by-default; debug runtime semantics
    are governed by `flutter_android_engine`'s engine selection, not by
    `BuildConfig.DEBUG`.

    Args:
        android_src_dir: Source dir under the repository root (e.g.
            `android/src/main`) when there are Android sources, or empty
            when there aren't.
        java_package: The plugin's Android namespace — resolved the way
            AGP resolves it (`android.namespace` in `build.gradle(.kts)`,
            else the manifest's `package` attribute), falling back to
            `flutter.plugin.platforms.android.package` from the pubspec.
            Used as `custom_package` on the `kt_android_library` so the
            generated `R` and `BuildConfig` classes land in the package
            the plugin's sources expect.
        extra_maven_labels: Additional `@rules_android_maven//:...`
            labels parsed from the plugin's `build.gradle*` and translated
            via `maven_labels_for_gradle` (the built-in table plus
            `flutter.pub(android_maven_deps)`).
        android_manifest: Path to the plugin's
            `android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` if it ships one, or
            empty. When set, the generated `kt_android_library` declares
            `manifest = ...` so `android_binary`'s manifest merger
            (`ManifestMerger2`) picks the plugin's `<activity>` /
            `<service>` / `<uses-permission>` / etc. entries up
            transitively — same shape AGP uses inside `flutter build apk`.
        consumer_proguard_specs: Paths (relative to the repository's
            `android/` sub-package) to ProGuard / R8 keep-rule files
            the plugin declared via `consumerProguardFiles` in its
            `build.gradle`. Threaded through as `proguard_specs = [...]`
            on the generated `kt_android_library`; rules_android
            propagates them transitively to the consuming
            `android_binary`'s R8 invocation, mirroring AGP's
            `consumerProguardFiles` flow.
        has_resources: True when the plugin ships resources at
            `android/src/main/res/`. Compiled via `resource_files` so the
            plugin's `R` class is generated against `java_package` and
