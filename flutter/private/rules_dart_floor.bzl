"""Floor check for the resolved `ai_rules_dart` module.

`rules_flutter` needs `ai_rules_dart` 0.21.0 (see `MODULE.bazel`), but a root
module override (`archive_override`, `git_override`, `local_path_override`
or `single_version_override`) replaces that resolution while Bazel ignores
the overridden module's `bazel_dep` version. Release archives carry no module
version and overridden modules report none, so the version cannot be read:
this module probes the behaviour the floor exists for instead. The 0.21.0
pubspec reader refuses a non-map `environment`; the 0.20.0 one silently reads
past it. One tiny parse per extension evaluation keeps the check cheap, and
everything the check needs (the floor, the probe and the message) lives here
so a floor bump touches one file.
