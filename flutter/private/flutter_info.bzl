"""The `FlutterInfo` constructor.

`FlutterInfo` is built by several rules — `flutter_library`, `flutter_plugin`,
`flutter_native_asset`, `flutter_data_asset` and `flutter_material_icons`.
Construction goes through here so no caller decides how a field merges: a rule
that does not contribute on a channel must still forward its dependencies'
values, and writing `depset()` instead silently drops them.

Reading does not go through here: `FlutterInfo` stays public and is indexed
directly by every consumer.

This mirrors `dart_info()` in rules_dart, deliberately — the two providers
travel together and a reader who has understood one should recognise the other.
The one structural difference is that `DartInfo` always records a package of
its own, so it needs a second constructor for the degenerate case, while every
`FlutterInfo` channel is optional by nature. Contributing on none of them is an
ordinary call with no arguments, not a special one.
