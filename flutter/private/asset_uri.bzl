"""One URI normalizer for every Flutter asset path (RT35-flutter:01).

flutter_tools 3.47.7 reads every `flutter:` entry that names a file as a
URI: assets in both forms and shaders via `AssetsEntry.parseFromYamlSafe`
(`flutter_manifest.dart:826-841`, which calls `Uri.parse(entry)`), font
files via `Uri.parse(fontFile['asset'])` (`flutter_manifest.dart:421`). It
finds the file from the decoded `pathSegments` (`asset.dart:1185`,
`1402-1428`) and keys the bundle by the percent-encoded path:
`Uri(pathSegments: ['packages', name, ...segments]).path` for a package
(`asset.dart:1425-1428`), the entry's URI path for the app
(`asset.dart:617`). The key is also the file name inside flutter_assets
(`bundle_builder.dart:182`, `build_system/targets/assets.dart:126`), and
the engine percent-encodes the key it asks for, so the bundle must carry
the encoded spelling.

rules_flutter used to keep the raw entry text as both file name and key, so
`./a.png` failed the spoke fetch with an unhelpful target-name error while
flutter_tools bundles it as `a.png`, and `a b.png` bundled under the key
`a b.png` while flutter_tools (and hence the engine) uses `a%20b.png`.

This module does what `Uri.parse` plus `Uri(pathSegments:)` do for a
relative path entry: split on `/`, decode valid `%XX` escapes as UTF-8,
dot-resolve `.` / `x/..` on the decoded segments the way Dart does (so an
escaped `%2E` counts as `.`), then re-encode each segment leaving RFC 3986
unreserved characters, sub-delims, `:` and `@` literal and emitting every
other UTF-8 byte as uppercase `%XX` (a lone `%` becomes `%25`). A raw
backslash reads as a path separator exactly as `Uri.parse` reads it
(before dot resolution and before percent-decoding, so
`assets/../x.png` with backslash separators is `x.png`);
a `%5C` escape stays a literal backslash byte and is still refused, as on
the base. An empty segment stays in the key (`assets/e//em.png` keys with
`//`) while the decoded file collapses it (`assets/e/em.png`), as
flutter_tools keys `entryUri.path` but reads `path.fromUri`. Anything
that cannot bundle as flutter_tools would — a query, a fragment, a scheme,
a leading `/`, a `..` that leaves the
package, an escape decoding to `/` or to bytes that are not UTF-8, or a
byte no Bazel target can name (`:`, a backslash, a control character) — is
a refusal carrying the reason; the caller fails naming the package, its
pubspec.yaml and the entry. The label always names the decoded
(collapsed) file; only the bundle key keeps the `//` spelling. Entries whose first segment is `packages`
normalize like every other entry (`packages/d/./a.png` bundles as
`packages/d/a.png`, with dot segments resolved and escapes keyed as
flutter_tools keys them); a reference into another package normalizes to
itself, so the declaring package's walk still refuses it as missing, as on
the base.

Bazel 9.3 Starlark indexes strings by byte and offers no `chr`/`ord`, so
the normalizer works one byte at a time over a 256-byte table (`_BYTES`,
written with octal escapes, the only escapes the lexer takes past 0x7F):
escape bytes parse with a hex lookup, decoded bytes rebuild with table
slices, and UTF-8 validity is checked on the byte values with integer
arithmetic.
"""

# Every byte value 0-255 at its own index, so `_BYTES.find(unit)` reads a
# byte and `_BYTES[v:v + 1]` writes one. Octal escapes are the only way to
# spell bytes past 0x7F in a .bzl literal.

    caller `fail()`s with it. Names the package, its pubspec.yaml and the
    entry, and says the spelling is not supported, so a refusal never comes
    out as a bundle under a key flutter_tools would not use.

        package_name: The pub package the entry comes from.
        entry: The entry text as written in pubspec.yaml.

            refusal reason).

    Returns:
        The error string; the caller `fail()`s with it.
