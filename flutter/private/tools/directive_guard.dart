// Flutter's half of the directive-URI check: the whole-program kernel compile
// (`frontend_server` behind `flutter_kernel_compile_action`) resolves its
// inputs through the app multi-root scheme across its `--filesystem-root`
// values, so the shared staged-source check cannot confine it. Only that
// Flutter-specific entry point lives here (`findDisallowedFlutterDirectives`,
// run by `kernel_filter.dart` over every declared source before the compiler
// runs); the prologue scanner, the scheme classifiers and the staged-path
// resolution it builds on come from rules_dart's public guard library
// (`@rules_dart//dart/guard:directive_guard`,
// `package:rules_dart_guard/directive_guard.dart`).
//
// The front end behind `flutter_kernel_compile_action` (`frontend_server`)
// loads `file:` URIs straight off the host filesystem, outside every
// `--filesystem-root`, so a compile that mounts the exec root would embed
// undeclared bytes and Bazel would cache the stale result. `kernel_filter.dart`
// runs this check over every declared source before the compiler runs, and
// verifies the compiler's own read set after it: together with the sandbox —
// or remote execution — exposing only declared inputs, these three layers are
// what keep undeclared bytes out of the dill, whatever a directive's spelling.
//
// Empty path segments and a leading `/` are decided here, not by the shared
// check (which refuses or skips them, and whose floor version this module
// resolves at):
//
// * A `package:` URI with an empty segment after the first segment that
//   follows the package name (`package:demo/src//d.dart`) is allowed unless
//   it climbs above its package once empty segments count as segments. An
//   empty segment directly after the package name (`package:demo//x.dart`)
//   makes the front end read the host path `/x.dart`, so it stays refused.
// * A schemeless relative URI with an empty segment (`../lib/src//d.dart`) is
//   resolved by RFC 3986 dot-segment removal with empty segments counted (so
//   `src//../b.dart` is `src/b.dart`, never `b.dart`), and is allowed exactly
//   when that names a declared source or a declared multi-root key.
// * A schemeless URI with exactly one leading `/` and no empty segment after
//   it, in a library under a package's `lib/` directory, resolves under that
//   `lib/` and is allowed exactly when the result is a declared source. A
//   `//` prefix, an empty segment after the slash, or a library outside any
//   `lib/` stays refused.
