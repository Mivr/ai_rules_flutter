/// `<uuid> <output.dill> <error count>`. No flag turns them off, and Bazel
/// shows an action's output on success. Every other line, errors above all,
/// passes through unchanged, as does the exit code.
///
/// Before the compiler runs, every declared source's directives are checked
/// against the declared inputs (`directive_guard.dart`): a directive that
/// names no declared file — a `file:` URI in any spelling, any other
/// unexpected scheme, or a relative URI climbing out of the declared inputs —
/// fails the build, under every strategy. The compile mounts a generated-only
/// stage plus the exec root, so under local and worker strategies undeclared
/// files are visible to the compiler: hermeticity rests on three layers — the
/// directive guard before the compile, the dependency report verified against
/// the declared-inputs manifest after it (failing closed on anything it
/// cannot verify), and the sandbox, or remote execution, which exposes only
/// declared inputs.
///
/// After the compiler runs, its `+file://` dependency lines are verified
/// against the same manifest: a read of a file the manifest does not name
/// fails the build instead of caching bytes Bazel never reruns on.
/// The lines are dropped either way, so a successful build stays silent.
/// The report is mandatory and fails closed: it must name a declared source
/// and the entrypoint, in a declared spelling, or the compile fails and its
/// output is deleted even when it exited 0.
///
/// The report cannot be switched off: the tool appends its own
/// `--print-incremental-dependencies` after the caller's flags (the last
/// occurrence wins in `frontend_server`'s `package:args` parsing), and a
/// compile that exits 0 while reporting no reads at all fails closed — a
/// real compile reads at least its entrypoint, so zero reads means the
/// report was silenced by other means.
///
/// The manifest is the only source of allowances: the tool derives nothing
/// from the compile argv. A flag smuggled into the argv (`--packages`,
/// `--import-dill`, `--platform` and the like, whether in `vm_flags` or
/// `extra_flags`) names no allowed read, and the refusal path deletes only
/// the manifest's output — never a path the argv names.
///
/// A plugin that is not available on the compiled platform fails the build
