/// Crash-safe scratch-directory ownership for the incremental worker.
///
/// A worker that is killed outright (Bazel destroying it, a server shutdown,
/// the OOM killer) never runs its graceful-exit cleanup, so its scratch
/// directory — full and incremental dills of tens of megabytes — would stay
/// in the host temp directory for good. Reclaiming that scratch must not
/// depend on the worker exiting gracefully: every worker, when it starts,
/// sweeps the temp directory for scratch left by workers that are no longer
/// alive.
///
/// Liveness is decided by something a dead process cannot keep holding: an
/// advisory exclusive file lock. Each worker publishes a lock file named
/// `lock` inside its own scratch and holds `lockSync(FileLock.exclusive)`
/// on it for its whole life; the kernel drops the lock when the process
/// dies, SIGKILL included, in every network and mount namespace. The claim
/// is published atomically: the worker creates `lock.claim`, locks it, and
/// renames it to `lock` on the same still-open handle — POSIX locks belong
/// to the inode, so the rename keeps the lock and `lock` never exists
/// unlocked. A directory with only the temporary claim, or none, is a
/// newborn mid-claim and is always kept. The sweep probes each sibling's
/// `lock` in process and read-only, attempting `lockSync(FileLock.shared)`:
/// the shared lock conflicts with a live owner's exclusive lock and fails
/// at once, and succeeds once the owner is dead. Acquiring it proves the
/// owner is gone and the directory is deleted, while a held lock, a missing
/// or unopenable lock file, or any other failure keeps the directory.
/// Liveness never depends on age or on PIDs, so PID reuse cannot confuse it.
///
/// The sweep only touches directories the worker's own naming scheme
/// produces (`incr_fkc_*`), never the worker's own directory, spawns no
/// process, and never fails the start or the compile: anything it cannot
/// remove is skipped with a note on stderr.
