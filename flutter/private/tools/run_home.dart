/// Every entry point a user can `bazel run` routes through here. The Dart CLI
/// writes dartdev telemetry (`.dart-tool/CLIENT_ID`,
/// `dart-flutter-telemetry*`, the dismissed-surveys file) whenever its front
/// end runs, and the global `--suppress-analytics` flag stops that write only
/// for command form. The launcher therefore uses one of two policies, chosen
/// by [runHomePolicy]:
///
/// * caller-home-suppressed: a command (`dart pub ...`, `dart format ...`,
///   `dart help`) keeps the caller's environment so `PUB_CACHE` and
///   credentials resolve, and [suppressAnalyticsFlag] is placed before the
///   command. The flag is global, so it must precede the command.
/// * private: a program file (`dart program.dart`) and an argv with no
///   positional argument at all (`dart`, `dart --help`, `dart --verbose`,
///   `dart --version`) run under a fresh directory for every home-locating
///   key ([privateHomeEnv]), removed afterwards ([createPrivateHome]). The VM
///   rejects the suppression flag for a program file (exit 255), and dartdev
///   still writes telemetry for `--verbose` even when the flag is present, so
///   a private home is the guarantee that holds for both.
///
/// An argv that already carries [noSuppressAnalyticsFlag] states that the
/// caller wants analytics; it still runs under a private home so the caller's
/// directories stay untouched. User app/test code keeps the caller env; only
/// rule-owned launchers and tool CLIs are routed through this library (plus
/// its shell counterpart `RUN_HOME_SH` in
/// `//flutter/private:run_home.bzl`, used where the launcher is a shell
/// template).
