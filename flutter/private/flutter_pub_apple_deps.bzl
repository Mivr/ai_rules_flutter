"""SwiftPM product links for a Flutter pub plugin's Apple libraries.

Pure functions over a parsed `Package.swift` and the hub's pin state. They
find the manifest target the plugin spoke builds, drop the products this
platform does not link, and resolve the rest to Bazel labels: a sibling
plugin's path package to that plugin's own Apple library, a remote pin to
its `<hub>__swiftpm-<identity>` spoke. Split out of
`flutter_pub_apple.bzl` so the plugin spoke's fetch code and this resolver
stay under the god-file limit; `flutter_pub_apple.bzl` loads
