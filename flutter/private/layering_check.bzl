"""The strict-layering (import) check for Flutter program rules.

rules_dart's `dart_binary` and `dart_test` refuse a source that imports a
package none of its direct `deps` provides. This file is the one place a
Flutter rule picks that check up, so every checked rule shares one wiring:

  * `LAYERING_CHECK_ASPECT` goes on the rule's `deps`,
  * `LAYERING_CHECK_ATTRS` into its `attrs`,
  * `LAYERING_CHECK_TOOLCHAINS` into its `toolchains`,
  * `layering_check()` returns what its `_validation` output group carries.

Checked rules: `flutter_test`, `flutter_application`, `flutter_web_bundle`.

The check is on by default; the `dart_layering_check` feature turns it off per
package or per build, exactly as in rules_dart.
