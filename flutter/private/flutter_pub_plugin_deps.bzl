"""Validation and selectors for `flutter.pub(ios_plugin_deps = ...)`.

The extension refuses a key that names no locked package before it creates
any spoke repository. A spoke then refuses an entry when the package has
no Apple sources or when an overlay BUILD replaces the generated Apple
targets, because either way the dependency would reach nothing. Every
helper is pure so unit tests drive them with plain strings and lists.
