"""Shared bounds for the `flutter pub` spoke directory walks.

Every spoke-side directory walk — asset listing (`flutter_pub_assets.bzl`
`list_files_recursive`), plugin source detection (`_has_files_under` in
`flutter_pub_package.bzl`), and path-package linking (`_link_scoped_tree`
there) — is a bounded Starlark `for` loop (Starlark has no `while`). All
three share `PUB_WALK_BOUND` and fail the fetch loudly at it, naming the
package, the directory, and the bound, instead of truncating or answering
from a half-walked tree. Starlark `range` is lazy and each walk is linear
in the directories it visits, so the high bound costs nothing until a walk
nears it.

The pure core (`has_files_under_walk`) works over a caller-provided
`readdir` callable so unit tests drive it with fakes; the spoke passes a
context-backed adapter and `fail()`s the fetch on the returned error. The
bound-error helpers return their message instead of failing so unit tests
can assert them; the caller `fail()`s with them.
