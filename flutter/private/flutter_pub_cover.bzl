"""Covering-entry lookup for `flutter.assets` failure messages.

A trailing-slash directory declaration covers every file walked out of it,
so a failure about a walked file names the declaration the user wrote
rather than the file. The index below records each declaration's position
so the lookup replays the scan's first-match-in-declaration-order rule
through dict lookups instead of a linear scan per file.

    exact file entries by path, trailing-slash directory entries by

    resolves in time linear in its own depth.

    Args:
