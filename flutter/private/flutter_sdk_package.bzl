"""Spoke repository rule for Flutter SDK packages (package:flutter).

Downloads the Flutter SDK source from GitHub and generates a dart_library
target for the framework. Follows the same hub/spoke pattern as rules_dart's
pub_lock_package, so it integrates seamlessly into the same hub repo.

The framework source tarball is downloaded and extracted once per SDK version
by `flutter_sdk_source_repo`; every spoke (and the gen-l10n repo) reads its
package out of that one extraction instead of unpacking the tarball again.

Like a pub spoke, an SDK spoke declares the language version its own
`environment.sdk` implies, which is what pub writes for these packages too.
Omitting it is not neutral: `package_config.json` reads a missing
`languageVersion` as the current SDK's.

    """Generate BUILD content for a Flutter SDK spoke.

    The "flutter" package uses flutter_library (not dart_library) so that
    its shader source files are propagated transitively via FlutterInfo.
    Other SDK packages (flutter_test, etc.) use plain dart_library.

    Both branches partition lib/ into `srcs` + `resources`, the same shape
    rules_dart's pub spokes use: everything under lib/ is addressable as
    `package:<name>/<path>` whatever its extension (package:flutter ships
    lib/analysis_options.yaml and lib/fix_data/*.yaml), so the non-Dart
    remainder rides `DartInfo.transitive_resources` rather than being
    dropped. The ink_sparkle .frag appears on both channels by design:
    `shaders` routes it through the impellerc compile into flutter_assets,
    `resources` keeps it a member of the staged package tree.

    Args:
        name: Package name (also the target name).
        deps: Fully-qualified Bazel label strings for sibling spokes.
        language_version: Dart language version string (e.g. `"3.11"`), or
            `""` when no pubspec was read. An empty string reaches the
            generated target as `language_version = ""`, which is what makes
            the `languageVersion` key absent from `package_config.json`
            entries downstream.

        BUILD.bazel content as a string.
