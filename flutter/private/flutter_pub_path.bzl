    The lock parser stringifies every description value, so a YAML

    Starlark, and the old truthiness test never refused it. Only the
    parsed string `"true"` (any case) or a real boolean `True` accepts
    the entry; `False`, a missing or empty value, or anything else
    refuses it. Returning a boolean instead of failing keeps the rule
    testable: `unittest` cannot assert on `fail()`.
