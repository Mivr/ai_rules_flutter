"""File-by-file mirroring for `path:` dependency spokes.

`link_path_package` (in `flutter_pub_package.bzl`) brings a
workspace-local package into its spoke. Real directories mirror file by
file into real repository directories, so the generator's `ctx.file`
writes land in the spoke, never in the user's tree through a symlinked
directory. A source symlink is never replicated as a directory: a link
to a directory resolves to its target, which is confined to the
workspace's real root, checked for cycles, and mirrored the same way.
Every link at any depth, file or directory, goes through the same
refusals, so a nested link can never smuggle outside bytes into the
spoke, and every mirrored file and directory is watched, so adding or
removing an entry refetches the spoke.

Skip rule: directory names in `_PATH_SPOKE_SKIP_DIRS` (build output,
tool state, the example app, dot-directories) are skipped at the
package root (the shader-sibling walk) and at the top level of each
mirrored platform or shader directory tree — never inside `lib/` or
inside a declared asset directory, whose trees mirror whole the way
`flutter_tools` reads them. Names directly under `lib/` such as
`lib/build/a.dart`, and names directly under a declared asset
directory, link normally, as do deeper names everywhere (plugin Kotlin
under `android/src/main/kotlin/com/example/`, files under
`lib/src/build/` or `lib/src/example/`), and dot-files inside declared
asset directories are kept. User `BUILD`
files are watched but never linked, at any depth, so a nested BUILD
file can never cut the spoke's globs into a second Bazel package.

Case rule: every path comparison here folds case exactly when the fetch
host proves case-insensitive (see `detect_case_insensitive_host`). On a
case-sensitive host comparisons stay exact, so two distinct entries that
differ only by case are never merged; on a case-insensitive host a
case-only difference can neither hide an escape nor loop the walk.

    Real directories become real repository directories holding one symlink
    per file, so the generator's `ctx.file` writes (the root and generated
    BUILD files) can never land in the user tree through a symlinked
    directory. Symlinks replicate without descending for files, and
    resolve, confine, cycle-check, and mirror for directories; skipped
    top-level subtrees (`build/`, `.dart_tool/`, `example/`,
    dot-directories) stay unlinked and unwatched so machine-local output
    cannot affect the fetch, except in `lib/` and declared asset directory
    trees (`apply_skip = False`), which mirror whole the way
    `flutter_tools` reads them; user BUILD files are watched but not linked.
    The walk shares the pub spoke bound (`PUB_WALK_BOUND`): reaching it
    with directories left over, or entering a symlink cycle, fails the
    fetch instead of fetching part of the tree.
