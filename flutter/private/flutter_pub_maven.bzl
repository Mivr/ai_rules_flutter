"""Android Maven inputs shared by the hosted and path pub spoke rules.

Both `flutter_pub_package` and `flutter_pub_path_package` run the same spoke
generator, which reads `android_maven_deps` and `android_maven_ignore` from
the repository context. The attribute declarations live here once so a path
plugin's `android/build.gradle*` is translated exactly like a hosted
plugin's, and `path_spoke_maven_inputs` names the pair the extension hands to
every path spoke.
