"""Tests for `path:` dependency spokes: scoped linking and lock-root resolution.

A path package is symlinked into its spoke, so the generator reads it in
place. The link plan parses the package's own `pubspec.yaml` from the spoke
and links only what the spoke generator reads or exposes:

* `lib/`, the pubspec, hook scripts, declared assets/fonts/shaders (plus
  each shader's own directory), and the plugin's platform directories —
  mirrored one file at a time into real repository directories, so the
  generator's `ctx.file` writes can never land in the user tree through a
  symlinked directory. A directory that arrives as a symlink resolves to
  its target and mirrors the same way — no directory is ever symlinked —
  and every link at any depth is confined to the workspace and checked
  for cycles.
* `example/`, `build/`, `.dart_tool/`, dot-directories, undeclared files,
  and user BUILD files stay unlinked — top-level skipped subtrees are not
  even watched, while every declared path is watched before testing
  whether it exists, so creating it later refetches the spoke instead of
  leaving its files silently missing. Below the top level only user BUILD
  files stay out (watched, never linked), so nested `example/`, `build/`,
  and dot-files link normally.
* Source links fail closed, naming the package and the link, when they
  resolve to the package or an ancestor, enter a symlink cycle, or leave
  the workspace's real root — as do the package directory itself and any
  of its parent components. Path comparisons fold case exactly when the
  fetch host proves case-insensitive.
* A `path:` entry resolves against the lock file's own directory, and only
  the root module's workspace is reachable from a spoke.
* The lock entry needs a true `relative` marker and a non-absolute path,
  and the package's pubspec `name` and `version` must match the lock entry
  (overlays and code assets are selected by lock name and version): a
  pubspec with no `version:` field reads as `0.0.0`, the way `pub get`
  locks it, and the two versions compare as parsed semantic versions —
  quoting, surrounding whitespace and the YAML scalar type do not matter,
  while an unparsable version on either side fails the fetch.
