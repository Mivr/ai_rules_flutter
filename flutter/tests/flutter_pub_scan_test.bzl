"""Unit tests for the hosted-archive guards in `flutter_pub_scan.bzl`.

A `flutter.pub` hosted spoke must scan its archive before trusting it to
the extractor: the header scan runs before `extract`, a refusal stops the
fetch before anything is extracted, and the symlink walk runs after
extraction. These tests pin that order with a mock repository context in
the same style as the overlay tests, driving the real
`fetch_hosted_archive` pipeline (including the real sha256 check and gzip
trim) with injected scan/walk fakes that log into the same event list as
the mock context. That a real refusal carries rules_dart's wording naming
the package and the entry is proven by the `e2e/pub_hosted_escape`
fixture, which greps each hostile fetch's message.
