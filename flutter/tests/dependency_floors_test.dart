/// Dependency-floor guard: every regular `bazel_dep` in the root
/// `MODULE.bazel` declares the minimum this repository supports, not the
/// release the repository happens to compile.
///
/// Bzlmod resolves a module to the highest version anywhere in the graph, so a
/// declaration is a floor inherited by every consumer. The checked-in table
/// (`dependency_floors.json`) records that floor and the symbol, package or
/// attribute that sets it; this test fails when a declaration is above its
/// floor (a consumer would be force-upgraded), when a dependency is missing
/// from the table, or when the root-only override that keeps this repository
/// on a current release is absent. `e2e/min_versions` proves the other half:
/// the floors build and the transitive lifts resolve at their lifted values.
///
/// The test reads `//:MODULE.bazel` and the table from `data`, so the inputs
/// are the tracked files rather than whatever a developer's working copy
/// happens to contain.
