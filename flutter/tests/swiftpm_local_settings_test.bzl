"""Build-level fixture for SwiftPM target-local header search paths.

SwiftPM applies `cSettings: [.headerSearchPath(p)]` to the declaring target
only. The fixture builds a small C library from the same settings struct the
translator consumes, with `p` reached through `implementation_deps`. Its
public consumer builds; the private consumer includes a header under `p` and
must fail to build:

    bazel build //flutter/tests:swiftpm_local_settings_private_consumer

`entries.private_includes` is the translated location of the search path, so
this fixture fails to load when the translator puts `p` back in a propagating
`includes` entry.
