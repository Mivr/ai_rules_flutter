"""Fan-in benchmark fixture (COV-63): bundle analysis cost vs dep count.

`asset_fanin_pool` declares one weighted base library carrying `p`
generated pub contributions (half font families, half plain assets) and a
fixed pool of thin libraries that each depend only on the base. The two
measured bundles live in the `narrow/` and `wide/` subpackages, declared
with `asset_fanin_narrow` (one thin dep) and `asset_fanin_wide` (every
thin dep), so that touching one bundle's BUILD file re-analyses only that
bundle. Analysis cost must be linear in the contributions a bundle ships,
so `wide - narrow` must not grow with `p`. Every target is `manual`: the
pool at `p = 6000` stays out of `//...` builds.
