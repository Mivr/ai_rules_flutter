"""Extensions for bzlmod.

Installs a Flutter toolchain and optionally resolves pub dependencies
(including Flutter SDK packages like package:flutter).

Every module can define a toolchain version under the default name, "flutter".
The root module's request wins when it makes one (even when a dependency
requests a newer SDK); without a root request the latest of those versions
will be selected (the rest discarded), and will always be registered by
rules_flutter.

Additionally, the root module can define arbitrarily many more toolchain versions under different
names (the latest version will be picked for each name) and can register them as it sees fit,
effectively overriding the default named toolchain due to toolchain resolution precedence.

The root module can also register custom Flutter releases missing from
`flutter/private/versions.bzl` with `flutter.version(...)`, and can source a
toolchain out of a pre-extracted local SDK with
`flutter.toolchain(local_path = ...)` instead of downloading. See
docs/flutter-sdk-versions.md.
