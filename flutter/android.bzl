"""Flutter rules for Android builds.

Two tiers of API:

    Tier 1 — flutter_android_app (self-contained, recommended):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl", "flutter_android_app")
        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:defs.bzl", "flutter_application")

        flutter_application(name = "my_app", main = "lib/main.dart", deps = [...])

        flutter_android_app(
            name = "my_app_android",
            application = ":my_app",
            package_name = "com.example.myapp",
        )

    Prerequisites: run `flutter create --platforms=android .` in your package to
    generate the conventional `android/app/src/main/` directory with
    AndroidManifest.xml, resources, and Kotlin sources. The macro handles everything
    automatically — no edits to the flutter create output needed.

    Tier 2 — composable rules (advanced, full control):

        load("@rules_flutter//flutter:android.bzl",
            "ANDROID_MIN_SDK_VERSION",
            "ANDROID_TARGET_SDK_VERSION",

            "flutter_android_manifest_merge",
            "flutter_android_runner_lib_gen")

        flutter_android_bundle(name = "my_bundle", application = ":my_app")
        flutter_android_engine(name = "my_engine")
        flutter_android_manifest_gen(name = "my_manifest", package_name = "com.example.myapp")

        flutter_android_runner_lib_gen(
            name = "my_runner",
            package_name = "com.example.myapp",
            engine = ":my_engine",
        )

            manifest = ":my_manifest",

    Discovers runner files from the conventional `android/app/src/main/`
    directory (as generated by `flutter create --platforms=android .`) and
    wires up all internal targets automatically.

    Three modes, and which one an app is in decides what it can express:
      1. `manifest` provided → uses it directly, with **no** `${...}`
         placeholder preprocessing and no resource/Kotlin auto-discovery.
         Handing this attribute the same `android/app/src/main/`
         AndroidManifest.xml mode 2 would have discovered therefore fails —
         `flutter create` writes `android:name="${applicationName}"` and
         nothing substitutes it. Use mode 2 for `flutter create` output;
         mode 1 is for a manifest you wrote yourself.
      2. android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml found → uses flutter create
         manifest (preprocessed for Gradle variables), discovers resources
         and Kotlin sources from android/app/src/main/. The main manifest is
         used in **every** compilation mode.
      3. No manifest found → generates manifest from template.

    `permissions` adds `<uses-permission>` elements to the effective manifest
    in every mode and every compilation mode, so it is the answer in all
    three — see the attribute's documentation below.

    Debug variant manifests (the Gradle merge Bazel lacks): flutter create
    declares `android.permission.INTERNET` only in
    `android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`. Without it a debug APK
    cannot host the Dart VM service (Android enforces INTERNET at the
    kernel level via AID_INET), so hot reload and debugging are impossible.
    This macro folds the debug variant into `-c dbg` APKs, controlled by
    `debug_manifest`:
      - None (default) → discover android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml;
        when present, its permissions are merged into the main manifest for
        `-c dbg` builds only. Requires a main manifest (mode 1 or 2).
      - a label → merge that variant manifest instead of discovering one.
      - False → no debug variant handling, even if the file exists.
    Release (`-c opt`, the default) APKs always use the main manifest
    unchanged — so a `flutter create` app that networks perfectly in `-c dbg`
    has **no** `INTERNET` permission in release, and Android enforces that at
    the kernel level (AID_INET group membership): every socket fails with
    `EACCES`, with no build error and no diagnostic. The dbg-only grant is a
    *debugging* requirement, not the app's network grant. An app that
    networks must declare it for itself, via `permissions`.
    `profile_manifest` does the same for profile builds (`-c opt` with
    `--@rules_flutter//flutter:profile`), from
    android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml, which `flutter create`
    writes with the `INTERNET` permission the VM service needs.

    When Kotlin sources are found in android/app/src/main/kotlin/, they are
    compiled via kt_android_library with the Flutter engine and AndroidX deps.

    Plugin auto-wiring:
      - Generates a `flutter_android_registrant` target whose application is
        `application`, then compiles the resulting Java into a private
        `kt_android_library` that goes into `binary_deps`. Every plugin
        whose `flutter.plugin.platforms.android.pluginClass` is set ends up
        registered with the FlutterEngine on startup — no manual wiring.
      - Adds `@<pub_hub_name>//android:all_android_plugin_libs` to
        `binary_deps`, pulling in every transitively-resolved plugin
        spoke's Kotlin/Java sources (and resources) via the hub's
        aggregator. Spokes without Android sources contribute empty
        libraries (no-op).
      - Permissions that plugins and AARs declare in their own manifests
        (e.g. record_android's RECORD_AUDIO) are lifted into the app's
        manifest, as AGP merges them. Bazel's own merger drops library
        permissions unless `--merge_android_manifest_permissions` is set;
        the app no longer depends on that flag.

    The app target builds rules_android's Go host tools in rules_go pure
    mode (no C++ toolchain, so the hermetic LLVM runtimes are never
    compiled from source), scoped to this app:
    `--@rules_flutter//flutter:android_pure_go=false` opts out, for example
    when the app's own subtree needs cgo. See the README's Android section
    for the trade-off.

    Release signing: by default the APK signs with the debug keystore, as an
    `android_binary` does. To sign the APK with a release key, pass `keystore` (a `.jks`
    or PKCS#12 `.p12` file label) together with `keystore_password_file` (a
    file label) and `key_alias` (a string); set `key_password_file` (a file
    label) as well when the key has its own password. The
    overlay then signs with `--ks`, `--ks-key-alias`, `--ks-pass
    file:<path>` and, when `key_password_file` is set, `--key-pass
    file:<path>`: both passwords are read from files at execution time and
    never appear on the command line. When `key_password_file` is unset,
    `--key-pass` is omitted and apksigner unlocks the key with the keystore
    password. A `keystore` without `keystore_password_file` or `key_alias` fails
    analysis naming the missing attribute. When `keystore` is unset, the
    `//flutter:android_release_keystore`,
    `//flutter:android_release_keystore_password_file` and
    `//flutter:android_release_key_alias` flags supply the same three
    values, so CI can inject a secret without editing BUILD files; an
    explicit attribute always wins over its flag. Every secret setting must
    name a target with exactly one file — an empty or multi-file target
    fails analysis instead of silently debug-signing — and the release
    signing action runs locally only (`no-remote`), so the secrets never
    reach remote execution or caches. Google Play takes new apps as an
    Android App Bundle, not an APK: see `flutter_android_aab`. See the
    README's Android section.

    Release signing never passes `debug_signing_lineage_file` to apksigner:
    the release APK carries no `--lineage` and the overlay reports no
    lineage, while debug signing keeps it (see
    `docs/android-release-signing.md`).

    Args:
        name: Target name (Bazel identifier). Produces the app APK (an android_binary behind a pure-Go proxy).
        application: A flutter_application target (required).
        package_name: Android package name, e.g. "com.example.myapp" (required).
        app_name: User-facing display name. Defaults to name.
        android_abi: Target ABI — "arm64" (default) or "x64". Selects the
            engine and the Android platform the application is built for.
        min_sdk_version: Minimum Android SDK version.
        target_sdk_version: Target Android SDK version.
        manifest: Override AndroidManifest.xml. If not set, auto-discovered
            from android/app/src/main/ or generated from template.
        debug_manifest: Debug variant manifest merged into `-c dbg` APKs.
            None (default) discovers android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml;
            a label overrides discovery; False disables variant handling.
        profile_manifest: Profile variant manifest merged into profile APKs.
            None (default) discovers android/app/src/profile/AndroidManifest.xml;
            a label overrides discovery; False disables variant handling.
        permissions: Permission names — e.g.
            `["android.permission.INTERNET"]` — added to the effective
            manifest in **every** compilation mode and in all three manifest
            modes. This is what a networked app needs: `flutter create`
            grants `INTERNET` in the debug variant only, so without this the
            release APK cannot open a socket. A permission the manifest
            already declares is not duplicated. For a permission wanted in
            `-c dbg` alone, use `debug_manifest` instead; this attribute is
            consumed by the macro and cannot be a `select()`.
        resources: Extra resource_files for android_binary.
        deps: Extra deps for android_binary (e.g. custom android_library).
            A plugin written in the workspace goes here as its
            `flutter_android_plugin_library`: the registrant compiles
            against these too, so the plugin is both packaged and
            registered. Pub plugins arrive through the hub instead.
        pub_hub_name: Name of the `flutter.pub(name = ...)` hub providing
            plugin spokes. The macro depends on
            `@<pub_hub_name>//android:all_android_plugin_libs` to compile
            all plugin Kotlin/Java automatically. Defaults to `"deps"`,
            matching the convention in repo MODULE.bazel files. Set to
            `None` to opt out (e.g. for a workspace with no pub plugins).
        nocompress_extensions: Extra asset extensions stored uncompressed in
            the final APK, on top of the aapt2 defaults (see
            FLUTTER_APK_AAPT_NO_COMPRESS_EXTENSIONS). Forwarded to both the
            payload-free android_binary and the overlay that injects the
            Flutter payload, so both agree on the compression policy.
            Matched case-sensitively by suffix.
        keystore: Release keystore (a `.jks` or PKCS#12 `.p12` file label)
            signing the APK instead of the debug keystore. Needs
            `keystore_password_file` and `key_alias`; without them analysis
            fails naming the missing attribute. Unset (with the
            `//flutter:android_release_keystore` flag unset) keeps debug
            signing. An explicit keystore always wins over the flag.
        keystore_password_file: File holding the release keystore's
            password, read by apksigner at execution time through `--ks-pass
            file:<path>`. The password text never appears on the command
            line. Only the first line is read, so end the file with a
            newline. Falls back to the
            `//flutter:android_release_keystore_password_file` flag.
        key_alias: Alias of the signing key inside `keystore`. Falls back to
            the `//flutter:android_release_key_alias` flag.
        key_password_file: File holding the signing key's own password, read
            through `--key-pass file:<path>`. When unset, `--key-pass` is
            omitted and apksigner unlocks the key with the keystore password;
            the same first-line-and-newline rule applies when it is set.
        analyze_size: Whether to emit an instructions-size JSON (<name>_size.json)
            from gen_snapshot and expose it in default outputs and the
            analyze_size output group. Works in release and profile modes;
            fails analysis in debug mode.
        **kwargs: Passed through to android_binary.

    this rule never debug-signs it and takes no signing attribute. Signing the

    sign it yourself (for example with `jarsigner`) before uploading.

    It wires the same runner, registrant, plugins and manifest as
    `flutter_android_app`, then builds the bundle with rules_android's public
    `android_application` macro (`@rules_android//android:rules.bzl`) and a
    minimal bundle config. The proto-format resource link, the module
    conversion and `bundletool build-bundle` are that macro's own actions, with
