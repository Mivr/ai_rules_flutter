A flow carries ``toolchain_floor`` (median CPU seconds over the repeats,
the same unit and rounding as ``sol``), ``floor_identical``,

``bazel_over_toolchain_floor`` (bazel / toolchain_floor). Records without
floor keys (``--floor=off``, web flows, the base writer) add nothing, so
the file is the base's.
