"""Speed-of-light (SOL) cost for the Flutter perf bench.

For each bench configuration (iOS, Android and Web; release and debug) and
each scenario (``clean``, ``app_edit``, ``core_edit``) this tool measures
two numbers in the same unit, whole-tree user+sys CPU seconds:

- the Bazel cost: for ``clean``, the whole ``bazel --batch build``
  process tree (Bazel's own work plus every action), measured with wait4
  rusage deltas, which include reaped descendants on both macOS and
  Linux; for the edit flows, the same cost measured against a warm Bazel
  server (``tools/perf/warm_server.py``): the client plus the server
  tree's growth during the command. A developer edits against a warm
  server, while ``--batch`` pays JVM start and a cold load and analysis
  on every edit, so the edit number follows the developer;
- the SOL cost: the minimal chain of the same tool binaries Bazel ran
  for that scenario, taken from that build's execution log (kernel
  compile, gen_snapshot, assembler/linker, bundling steps, with the same
  flags and inputs), run by hand in order. The SOL number is the sum of
  the chain steps' own process-tree CPU: the driver's own cost (loading
  the log, hashing, moving files) is never included.

A host-tool build is a spawn whose declared outputs land in an exec
configuration (``bazel-out/*-exec-*/``); those are not part of the chain
(building Bazel's helper tools is part of the gap). Every other executed
spawn runs, whatever tool binary it invokes: an action that runs an
exec-built tool to produce target-configuration outputs (the kernel
compile, for example) belongs in the chain. Steps whose outputs did not
change for an edit are skipped as a person would skip them: the
execution log records executed spawns only.

Proof the SOL did the same work: each chain step runs as Bazel runs it
(its declared outputs are removed before it starts), steps run in
dependency order even for edges the execution log never records (a
step whose input is, or resolves to, another step's output runs after
it), and the scenario's final outputs are moved aside before the chain
and hashed after. device_release hashes the App.framework binary;
sim_debug hashes every file in the final app bundle's payload (an
.ipa archive's entries, or every file under an .app directory),
compared by entry path and content: archive metadata such as zip
timestamps is not part of the proof. Android hashes every entry of each
declared .apk/.aab archive the same way; Web hashes every file under
each declared web output directory. The verify set comes from
declared outputs only, never a glob over bazel-out. A step that exits
non-zero, times out or cannot start — a step that would start while an
input is still a moved-aside output no earlier step re-created — or
any verify entry that differs afterwards — reports ``identical``
false with no SOL number. Bazel's outputs are moved back afterwards
and chain-created files no step declares are removed, so a chain can
never perturb the next incremental build's action cache.

Every flow also carries a small ``profile`` record, always on, with no
command lines: ``jvm`` is Bazel's own CPU from the build's ``--profile``
JSON trace (the "CPU usage (Bazel)" counter integrated over time and
split at the build-phase markers; the counter starts after JVM launch,
so launch CPU lands in ``residual``), ``host_tools`` replays the
chain-excluded host-tool builds under the same wait4 method after the
chain restores Bazel's outputs (a host build that fails to replay is
recorded, not fatal), and ``residual`` is ``bazel - jvm - sol -
host_tools``, never clamped — a failed chain has no SOL number, and
the record says so and substitutes the chain CPU instead. The gzipped
trace profiles and execution logs behind each record are uploaded as
the ``ios-profile`` artifact (no build outputs).

Subcommands: ``run`` measures repeats, ``chain`` runs one chain (an
unmeasured child process), ``summarize`` writes medians into
``<platform>-sol.json`` (``ios``, ``android`` or ``web``).
