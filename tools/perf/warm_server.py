"""Whole-tree CPU of one command run against a warm Bazel server.

The iOS bench's clean builds stay ``bazel --batch`` (measured with wait4
deltas), but an edit build is what a developer pays against a running
server: no JVM start, no cold load and analysis. This module measures one
such command so the Android and web benches can reuse the method.

The cost of one command is the sum of:

- the client process's own whole-tree CPU (wait4 / RUSAGE_CHILDREN of the
  client, as for batch builds);
- the server process's growth in its own CPU plus the CPU of the children
  it reaped (finished) during the command;
- the growth, for every live descendant of the server (persistent workers
  and their children), in its own CPU plus its reaped children's CPU. A
  descendant that appears during the command counts from zero.

Each value is sampled before and after the command. The return carries CPU
seconds (user and sys), real seconds, the server pid, a per-part breakdown
(``client`` / ``server_self`` / ``server_reaped`` / ``descendants``) and
the method name ``warm-server``.

Fail closed: a missing server pid, a server that restarts mid-command
(same pid, different start token), or a sample that cannot be read raises
``WarmServerError``, which the caller records as the flow's reason. A
partial number is never returned as if it were whole.

Backends: Linux reads ``/proc/<pid>/stat`` (utime, stime, cutime, cstime
in clock ticks, ``SC_CLK_TCK``) and finds children through ``/proc``.
macOS reads libproc through ctypes: ``proc_pid_rusage`` with
``RUSAGE_INFO_V2`` (``ri_user_time``, ``ri_system_time``,
``ri_child_user_time``, ``ri_child_system_time`` in Mach absolute-time
units, converted with ``mach_timebase_info``, which is not 1/1 on Apple
silicon) and ``proc_listchildpids`` for children. The backend interface
is one function per platform to read a pid's own and reaped-children CPU
(``linux_read`` / ``mac_read``) and one to list its children
(``linux_children`` / ``mac_children``), so another counter (e.g. Linux
instructions) can be added later behind the same shape.

Known limit: a descendant that exits during the command is counted
through its parent's reaped-children time over its whole life, including
CPU it used before the command. Exited processes cannot be sampled, so
their pre-command share cannot be subtracted.
